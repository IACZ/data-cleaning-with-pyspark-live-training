The Spark CSV reader has an option for a `comment` property, which actually defaults to skipping all rows starting with a `#` character. That said, it only supports a single character - consider if you were looking for multi-character options (ie, a // or /* from C-style syntax). This feature is also only available in newer versions of Spark, where our method works in any of the 2.x Spark releases."
